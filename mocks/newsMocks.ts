                'Right and to your point, there&#x27;s not a whole lot of precedent for browsers successfully funding themselves when the browser itself is the primary product.<p>Opera was the lightweight high performance extension rich, diversely funded, portable, adapted to niche hardware, early to mobile browser practically built from the dreams of niche users who want customization and privacy. They&#x27;re a perfect natural experiment for what it looks like to get most, if not all decisions right in terms of both of features users want, as well as creative attempts to diversify revenue. But unfortunately, by the same token also the perfect refutation of the fantasy that making the right decisions means you have a path to revenue. If that was how it worked, Opera would be a trillion dollar company right now.<p>But it didn&#x27;t work because the economics of web browsers basically doesn&#x27;t exist. You have to be a trillion dollar company already, and dominate distribution of a given platform and force preload your browser.<p>Browsers are practically full scale operating systems these days with tens of millions of lines of code, distribued for free. Donations don&#x27;t work, paying for the browser doesn&#x27;t work. If it did, Opera (the og Opera, not the new ownership they got sold to) would still be here.',

                'Right and to your point, there&#x27;s not a whole lot of precedent for browsers successfully funding themselves when the browser itself is the primary product.<p>Opera was the lightweight high performance extension rich, diversely funded, portable, adapted to niche hardware, early to mobile browser practically built from the dreams of niche users who want customization and privacy. They&#x27;re a perfect natural experiment for what it looks like to get most, if not all decisions right in terms of both of features users want, as well as creative attempts to diversify revenue. But unfortunately, by the same token also the perfect refutation of the fantasy that making the right decisions means you have a path to revenue.

I just reject the illegal vacuuming up of everyones' art for corporations while things like sampling in music remain illegal. This idea that everything must be efficient comes from the bowels of Silicon Valley and should die.<p>&gt; However tech people who thinks AI is bad, or not inevitable is really hard to understand. It\u2019s almost like Bill Gates saying \u201cwe are not interested in internet\u201d. This is pretty much being against the internet, industrialization, print press or <em>mobile</em> phones. The idea that AI is anything less than paradigm shifting, or even revolutionary is weird to me. I can only say being against this is either it\u2019s self-interest or not able to grasp it.<p>Again, the problem is less the tech itself and the corporations who have control of it.

                'Tech artist here so I hit a middle ground.<p>&gt; I understand artists etc. Talking about AI in a negative sense, because they don\u2019t really get it completely, or just it\u2019s against their self interest which means they find bad arguments to support their own interest subconsciously<p>&gt;But somehow if a person \u201cinfluenced\u201d by people, ideas, art in less efficient way almost we applaud that because what else, invent the wheel again forever?<p>I understand AI perfectly fine, thanks. I just reject the illegal vacuuming up of everyones&#x27; art for corporations while things like sampling in music remain illegal. This idea that everything must be efficient comes from the bowels of Silicon Valley and should die.<p>&gt; However tech people who thinks AI is bad, or not inevitable is really hard to understand. It\u2019s almost like Bill Gates saying \u201cwe are not interested in internet\u201d. This is pretty much being against the internet, industrialization, print press or mobile phones. The idea that AI is anything less than paradigm shifting, or even revolutionary is weird to me. I can only say being against this is either it\u2019s self-interest or not able to grasp it.<p>Again, the problem is less the tech itself and the corporations who have control of it. Yes, I&#x27;m against corporations gobbling up everyones&#x27; data for ads and AI surveillance. I think you might be the one who doesn&#x27;t understand that not everything is roses and their might be more weeds in the garden than flowers.',
